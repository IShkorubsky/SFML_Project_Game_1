This was my first project using SFML. In this game the player is tasked to click on any falling cubes to gain points.
If the balls reach the bottom of the screen the player looses health.

This project was created to initiate my learnings into the SFML library. 
With this project I learned:

- How to create and render a window to the screen;
- How to spawn and render an object;
- How to check for mouse position and click to check if the player clicked within the bounds of the object;
- How to add points, update the points and render the text to the window.
